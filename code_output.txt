<<\DOC_END

This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /
	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
	    /   /   /   /             \     /
    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"


A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

=== /Users/sic/dev/t0nylombardi/copy_code/.git/hooks/push-to-checkout.sample ===
#!/bin/sh

# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
#
# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
# updateInstead.
#
# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
# as a starting point for convenient modification.
#
# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
# branch is going to be updated:
commit=$1

# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
die () {
	echo >&2 "$*"
	exit 1
}

# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
#
# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
# not interfere with the difference between the branches.

# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
#
# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
# by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.

# An example hook script to block unannotated tags from entering.
# Called by "git receive-pack" with arguments: refname sha1-old sha1-new
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "update".
#
# Config
# ------
# hooks.allowunannotated
#   This boolean sets whether unannotated tags will be allowed into the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.allowdeletetag
#   This boolean sets whether deleting tags will be allowed in the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.allowmodifytag
#   This boolean sets whether a tag may be modified after creation. By default
#   it won't be.
# hooks.allowdeletebranch
#   This boolean sets whether deleting branches will be allowed in the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.denycreatebranch
#   This boolean sets whether remotely creating branches will be denied
#   in the repository.  By default this is allowed.

![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/copy_code.svg)
![Ruby](https://img.shields.io/badge/ruby-3.0%2B-red)
![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/t0nylombardi/copy_code/test.yml?branch=main)

A smart, flexible CLI tool to copy source code from a directory (or project) into your clipboard or a text file â€” while skipping unnecessary files using `.ccignore`.

---

## ğŸ”§ Features

- âœ… Recursively finds source code files in a target directory
- ğŸ§¹ Ignores folders like `.git`, `node_modules`, etc. using a `.copy_codeignore` file
- ğŸ¯ Filters by file extension (`--extensions=rb,py,js`)
- ğŸ“‹ Copies output to your clipboard or saves to a file (`--print=pbcopy|txt`)
- ğŸš Works from the terminal with one clean command

---

### Options

| flags                | options                                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -e, --extensions=EXT | Comma-separated list of file extensions to include (e.g. `-e rb,py`) |
| -p, --print=OUT      | Output format: `pbcopy` (clipboard) or `txt` (file)                  |
| -h                   | Show help information                                                |

## ğŸš€ Installation

```sh
gem install copy_code
```

Or clone and build manually:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username/copy_code.git
cd copy_code
gem build copy_code.gemspec
gem install ./copy_code-*.gem
```

## ğŸ›  Usage

```sh
copy_code [options] [paths]
```

### Examples

Copy all .rb and .py files from the current directory and subdirectories:

```sh
copy_code -e rb,py
```

Copy .js, .ts, and .json files from a specific folder and write to a file:

```sh
copy_code ~/projects/my-app -e js,ts,json -p txt
```

Copy all .rb and .py files from the current directory and subdirectories:

```sh
copy_code -e rb,py
```

Copy .js, .ts, and .json files from a specific folder and write to a file:

```sh
copy_code ~/projects/my-app -e js,ts,json -p txt
```

```sh
copy_code -e rb,py
```

Copy .js, .ts, and .json files from a specific folder and write to a file:

```sh
copy_code ~/projects/my-app -e js,ts,json -p txt
```

```sh
copy_code -e rb,py
```

### ğŸ“‚ .ccignore

You can create a `.ccignore` file in your project directory to specify files and directories to ignore. This works similarly to `.gitignore`.

### Example `.ccignore` file

```
# Ignore all node_modules directories
node_modules/
# Ignore all .git directories
.git/
# Ignore all log files
*.log
# Ignore all temporary files
*.tmp
# Ignore all coverage directories
coverage/
# Ignore all virtual environments
.venv/
```

<<\DOC_END

This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /

A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

=== /Users/sic/dev/t0nylombardi/copy_code/.git/hooks/push-to-checkout.sample ===
#!/bin/sh

# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
#
# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
# updateInstead.
#
# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
# as a starting point for convenient modification.
#
# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
# branch is going to be updated:
commit=$1

# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
die () {
	echo >&2 "$*"
	exit 1
}

# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
#
# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
# not interfere with the difference between the branches.

# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
#
# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
# by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.

![Ruby](https://img.shields.io/badge/ruby-3.0%2B-red)
![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/t0nylombardi/copy_code/test.yml?branch=main)

A smart, flexible CLI tool to copy source code from a directory (or project) into your clipboard or a text file â€” while skipping unnecessary files using `.ccignore`.

---

## ğŸ”§ Features

- âœ… Recursively finds source code files in a target directory
- ğŸ§¹ Ignores folders like `.git`, `node_modules`, etc. using a `.copy_codeignore` file
- ğŸ¯ Filters by file extension (`--extensions=rb,py,js`)
- ğŸ“‹ Copies output to your clipboard or saves to a file (`--print=pbcopy|txt`)
- ğŸš Works from the terminal with one clean command

---

### Options

| flags                | options                                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -e, --extensions=EXT | Comma-separated list of file extensions to include (e.g. `-e rb,py`) |
| -p, --print=OUT      | Output format: `pbcopy` (clipboard) or `txt` (file)                  |
| -h                   | Show help information                                                |

## ğŸš€ Installation

```sh
gem install copy_code
```

Or clone and build manually:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username/copy_code.git
cd copy_code
gem build copy_code.gemspec
gem install ./copy_code-*.gem
```

## ğŸ›  Usage

```sh
copy_code [options] [paths]
```

### Examples

Copy all .rb and .py files from the current directory and subdirectories:

```sh
copy_code -e rb,py
```

Copy .js, .ts, and .json files from a specific folder and write to a file:

```sh
copy_code ~/projects/my-app -e js,ts,json -p txt
```

Copy all .rb and .py files from the current directory and subdirectories:

```sh
copy_code -e rb,py
```

Copy .js, .ts, and .json files from a specific folder and write to a file:

```sh
copy_code ~/projects/my-app -e js,ts,json -p txt
```

```sh
copy_code -e rb,py
```

Copy .js, .ts, and .json files from a specific folder and write to a file:

```sh
copy_code ~/projects/my-app -e js,ts,json -p txt
```

```sh
copy_code -e rb,py
```

### ğŸ“‚ .ccignore

You can create a `.ccignore` file in your project directory to specify files and directories to ignore. This works similarly to `.gitignore`.

### Example `.ccignore` file

```
# Ignore all node_modules directories
node_modules/
# Ignore all .git directories
.git/
# Ignore all log files
*.log
# Ignore all temporary files
*.tmp
# Ignore all coverage directories
coverage/
# Ignore all virtual environments
.venv/
```
